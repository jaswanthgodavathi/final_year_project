# Integrated Smart Grid and Electricity Monitoring System

## Problem Statement

The current electric grid and billing systems suffer from several inefficiencies, including:
- Inefficient energy distribution
- Lack of real-time monitoring
- Billing errors
- Inadequate integration of renewable energy

These issues result in energy waste, high bills, and increased carbon footprints. A unified solution is needed to enhance grid management, integrate renewable energy, and provide consumers with real-time data and control over their electricity consumption.

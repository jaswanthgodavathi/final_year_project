# 🌍 Integrated Smart Grid and Electricity Monitoring System ⚡

## Overview

The **Integrated Smart Grid and Electricity Monitoring System** is a blockchain-based solution designed to enhance energy management, improve billing accuracy, and integrate renewable energy sources. This system empowers consumers with real-time data and control over their electricity consumption.

## Problem Statement

Current electric grid and billing systems face inefficiencies such as:
- 🔋 Inefficient energy distribution
- 📉 Lack of real-time monitoring
- 💰 Billing errors
- 🌱 Inadequate integration of renewable energy

These challenges lead to energy waste, high bills, and an increased carbon footprint. Our project addresses these issues by creating a unified solution for grid management and consumer engagement.

## Proposed Work

This project incorporates key components including:

- **Blockchain Infrastructure**: For secure transactions and automated billing.
- **Smart Meters**: To provide accurate energy consumption measurements and real-time data exchange.
- **Decentralized Wallet System**: For peer-to-peer energy trading and automated billing.
- **Machine Learning Models**: To predict demand spikes and forecast grid requirements.
- **Net Metering Mechanism**: To credit users for renewable energy contributions.
- **Mobile App**: A user-friendly Flutter app for monitoring energy usage.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and data management with Firebase.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Insights into consumption and cost calculations.

## Features

- 🔗 **Secure and Transparent Transactions** using blockchain technology
- 📱 **Real-Time Monitoring** through a mobile app
- 🌞 **Integration of Renewable Energy** sources
- 💡 **User-Friendly Interface** for seamless navigation

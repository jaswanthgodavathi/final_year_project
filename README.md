 Blockchain-Based Smart Electricity Monitoring and Sustainable Grid System with ML-Powered Demand Forecasting


Problem Statement: The current electric grid and billing systems suffer from inefficiencies in energy distribution, lack of real-time monitoring, billing errors, and inadequate integration of renewable energy. These issues lead to energy waste, high bills, and increased carbon footprints. A unified solution is needed to enhance grid management, integrate renewable energy, and provide consumers with real-time data and control over their electricity consumption.
Proposed Work: This project proposes an integrated, blockchain-based smart grid and electricity monitoring system incorporating renewable energy sources, smart metering, and machine learning-powered demand forecasting.
Blockchain Infrastructure: Secure and transparent energy transactions with automated billing through smart contracts.
Smart Meters: Accurate measurement of energy consumption and production with real-time data exchange.
Decentralized Wallet System: Automated billing and peer-to-peer energy trading.
Machine Learning Models: Predict demand spikes and forecast grid requirements for proactive energy management.
Net Metering Mechanism: Calculate and credit energy fed back into the grid to promote consumer participation.
Real-Time Monitoring Mobile App: Flutter-based app for monitoring and managing electricity usage with Firebase integration.
User Authentication and Data Management: Secure login and data synchronization using Firebase Authentication and Firestore.
Real-Time Monitoring and Data Visualization: Features for meter readings, usage tracking, and statistical data on consumption.
Calculations and Insights: Electricity bill estimation, carbon footprint, and appliance energy cost calculations.
User Interface and Experience: Intuitive and user-friendly interface ensuring seamless experience across devices.

Conclusion:  This integrated approach optimizes energy distribution, reduces waste, promotes renewable energy, and enhances grid stability, creating a sustainable, reliable, and user-centric energy ecosystem.
